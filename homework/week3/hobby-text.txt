Introduction to hobby:
I'm Peter and my hobby is playing basketball with my friends. I've loved basketball since I was 7 years old when I started going to the park with my brother to watch him play basketball with his friends and at times interrupt his games because I couldn't play yet at the time. I usually sat on the bench watching him playing with his friends thinking to myself that I would really want to try this sports because my brother really loved the game. So I generally credit my brother for exposing me to the game of basketball and teaching me in the early days to play the game and practice my dribbling and moves.

Tips to start this hobby:
I have various tips to learn how to learn basketball quickly. 
1/ one must have the stamina and strength to play the game because basketball requires the movement of all parts of of your body and is an exhausting sports. So to play the game, one must first build up stamina from cardio exercises like running, circuit training, cycling, and any other type of exercise of preference.
2/ From this step on, we will focus on practicing on ball handling. After having strength and stamina, one can move to the basic ball control dribbling. To start out, try dribbling any way you want on each hand and practice your coordination to have better control on the movement of the ball when you dribble it with both your right and left hand.
3/ After getting used to the hand coordination when you dribble the ball, we can move into more difficult ball handling exercises. For these exercises, there are so many variations one can create to get better at ball handling. But here are some exercises I recommend for beginners like V Dribble, Pins, Finger Tip Dribbling, and Figure 8 Dribbling. The goal of these exercises is to practice your ball handling and this skill is very important because when you master ball handling, you will be able to move the ball more naturally and have better overall control of the ball so your guard cannot steal your ball.

4/ Next, after feeling more natural with ball handling, we can move on to shooting. And personally, I feel that this skill can never be perfected and can be challenging for long time players. So as beginners, you can miss shots and don't feel too bad about it. Keep practicing your shooting form and overtime, you will improve. To start practicing this skill you must remember the acronym BEEF which stands for balance, eyes, elbow, and follow-through.

5/ At this point, you can start playing basketball games one-on-one with your friend. But if you want to have more fun and play games with your friends in a team of several people, you should start learning about team formations and practice those formations with your friends to coordinate with them better in real game situations. But at this point, you should be already pretty good and can understand how to move the ball well enough to come up with formations with your team members to up your gameplay against tough opponents. And you can also look up for a local basketball coach to help train your team to work better together.
