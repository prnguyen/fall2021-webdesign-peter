<p>This is a great book I found from San Jose Public Library that covers Javscript very comprehensively. It's a popular and highly rated title on Amazon to get started with Javascript. It's written by David Flanagan, an experienced programmer and author of many popular programming books about Java and Javascript with the O'Reilly publisher.</p>
