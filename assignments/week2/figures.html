<h2>Figures</h2>

<!-- The figure element is usually used for "attaching" text to an image. Note the difference between the alt text and the figcaption text, they usually have different purposes. --> 
<figure>
    <img src="images/pexels-cottonbro-4033340.jpg" alt="A nice vintage acoustic piano" />
    <figcaption>An acoustic piano I hope to own and play one day</figcaption>
</figure>

this is out on its own.

<h2>Quotes and Blockquotes</h2>

<!-- The q is to quote text INLINE (similar to how text flows). -->
<p>Just a random paragraph to demonstrate how the quote element works and <q>here is the quote</q>.</p>


<!-- The blockquote is to quote text as BLOCK-LEVEL element, usually for quoting large amounts of text, or text that is not quoted within your own paragraphs/text. -->
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Another random paragraph to demonstrate how the blockquote element works. <br>
        And this is the second line in the paragraph.
    </p>
</blockquote>
